# Starfall
A 3rd-person action shooter created for Georgia Tech's VGDEV Club in Fall 2022

# How to Play
- Kill as many enemies and survive for as long as possible to maximize your score. See how you stack up against all players with a global leaderboard.
- Use WASD to move, left click to shoot, and right click to aim.
- Press shift to dash.
- Press E to use your dagger ability. Throw your held daggers in a cone in front of you, bleeding enemies. Pressing E again will recall the daggers to you, dealing damage on the return. Daggers that strike already bleeding enemies will deal a burst of double damage.
- Press F to summon a clone that mirrors your inputs across the axis defined by your look direction at time of cast. Your clone deals triple your damage, and will mirror your other ability casts.

# Known Issues
- The game is too hard in general.
- The Utopia map is pitch black as a result of lighting glitches.
- The AI Manager will oftentimes spawn the wrong amount of enemies.
- Maps can be escaped by the player.
- High poly counts result in poor graphics performance.
